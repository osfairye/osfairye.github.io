title: About Lórien Gaesorix Osfairy

Lórien (or Lórien Gaesorix Osfairy) is the nom de plume of a city-dwelling, settler animist and witch who is exploring gallo-germanic polytheism and other continental heathenries. I use they/their/them pronouns.

I have been developing, since 2021, a reconstructed religious framework affectionately called Orchardcraft based on my explorations of Continental Germanic Heathenry and Gallo-Roman Polytheism.

My witchcraft is probably best described as herbalism-meets-hedgewitchery, inspired by folk tales. I am very much a “feel it out, trust my gut” kind of witch. I don’t believe that witchcraft can solve all my problems. It probably can solve a few of them, though.

As a settler and descendant of immigrants, I have a responsibility to commit to anti-racist and anti-colonial practices in my relationship with people on this land. As an animist and witch who came to their practice in the early 2000s, I absolutely have to commit to decolonizing my practice in the face of colonialism, imperialism, war, capitalism, poverty, and the ongoing human-created climate catastrophe.

This site is an archive of my public writings on witchcraft and animism since 2015, much of it very rough. Many of the older posts don’t represent my current outlook, but I consider them useful to keep around as perspective on my own journey and how far I’ve come.

Enjoy the scribbles for what they are: experiments, fumblings in the dark, and journeys of their own.
