This page should be considered a living document, subject to continuous work, and far from exhaustive.

I have been developing, since 2021, a reconstructed religious framework affectionately called Orchardcraft based on my explorations of Continental Germanic Heathenry and Gallo-Roman Polytheism.

These are some of the spirits I venerate on a regular basis (at least once a year, usually more often):

## Abelion

## Cathubodua
* [A Shrine for Cathubodua](/blog/poetry/2022/03/13/a-shrine-for-cathubodua.html)

## Epona

## Đirona
* [Đirona's Crown](/poetry/2022/03/07/dironas-crown.html)
