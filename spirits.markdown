This page should be considered a living document, subject to continuous work, and far from exhaustive.

I have been developing, since 2021, a reconstructed religious framework affectionately called Orchardcraft based on my explorations of Continental Germanic Heathenry and Gallo-Roman Polytheism.

These are some of the spirits I venerate on a regular basis (at least once a year, usually more often):

## Abelion

> Abelion, venerable spirit of apples and orchards, magnificent Abellio, sun god, of Beauty and Goodness, you who are sometimes named Abelio or Abelionni or even Belliou, who was sometimes called *Belenos norique* by the Gauls and whom the Romans identified with Apollo, mysterious god of my ancestors, I hope you'll grant us wonderful weather for picking fruit in this orchard, I adore you, Abelion!
