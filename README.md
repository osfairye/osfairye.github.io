# osfairye.github.io
This is the public repository for the Jekyll blog feeding osfairy.github.io. I'm not sure why you're here, unless you're future me wondering what the hell I was doing.

Get local Jekyll going:
1. `cd /Into/The/Git/Repository`
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If there is a problem:
1. `bundle exec jekyll doctor` will probably get to the bottom of it.
