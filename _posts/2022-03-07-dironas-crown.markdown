I spent hours watching the fresh-watered waves         
collide against the earth; thunder brewing at the tip top of         
the pines, glorious skies that unfurl out and deep into the west;         
the wind carrying sweet-water spray onto the land where I stand         
in the shadows of the trees, waiting for the first celestial bodies         
to rise behind me from the east. ƒêirona, most beloved star,         
crown of the heavens, watching the gulls dancing over the last rays         
of sun cresting the waves, a drum, a soft pitter-patter of pine needles         
brushing against each other; we contain in all of us these rocky         
shores, these watery edges; as the water becomes wine-dark like the         
black roses my grandmother grew along the stone steps up to her house,         
I reach the dark silhouette of my hand to the sky, and behind it         
all the light of the stars gleam as they shower down, meeting         
their mirror images reflected by the troubled horizon.
