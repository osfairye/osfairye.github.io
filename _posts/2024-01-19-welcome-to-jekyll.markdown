As of January 19, 2024, Osfairy has migrated to a free spot on Github and the blog posts are powered by Jekyll. Frankly, Wordpress was very expensive and beyond what I actually needed. I spent the large part of the day migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll, dusting off some extremely rusty web development skills to do so. The transition was not exactly seamless, unfortunately.

A big change is that a large part of the images that decorated various blog posts are gone. For the most part, it was just simpler to delete them than to think about how to bring them over and update all the URLs. There's a lot of deadlinks, as I haven't recreated the same categories and tags that existed on the Wordpress. Right now I've split the posts into only two categories, blog and poetry.
