The concept of the "pantheon of the gods," as many of us learn as children obsessed with taking books on mythology out of the library, is a fairly modern one. This is a concept that, according to [previous reading notes](https://www.osfairy.com/blog/2022/08/27/gaulish-religion-notes.html), can also be traced back to Ancient Gaul.
