At the beginning of the month, I launched a little poll on pagan.plus:

<iframe src="https://pagan.plus/@osfairy/111862726346429782/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600" height="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

My reach on pagan.plus is actually not very large, so I was pretty happy with the 45 participants. 

Personally, like 8 other polled members of pagan.plus, I actually prefer the term "polytheist" to describe myself. This is not the popular preference, which I find very interesting. I find "polytheist" to more accurately describe my own worldview, "pagan" really does feel more nebulous somehow, even though a lot of people feel like "pagan" implies "polytheism" â€” but historically, it didn't always. I also find "polytheist" useful because it allows me to delineate my religious views from "pantheism."

What about you? Do you prefer "polytheist" or "pagan" to describe yourself? I think I still prefer using the term "animist" (as seen in my bio on this blog), but in a pinch, "polytheist" is useful. 

### Interesting responses to the poll and this post:
