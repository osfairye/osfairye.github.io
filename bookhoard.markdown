Here are some of the texts that have informed my thinking and my practice. **Note that does not mean everything on this list is wholeheartedly endorsed;** there are a few things which I've kept because they cover topics that I'm interested in, and there just is not a ton of existing literature on the topic in question.

I will add to this list bit by bit as my reading continues. Feel free to bookmark this page, and return periodically.

## Articles

* [Decolonization Is Not A Metaphor](https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/18630) by Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (2012), " Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, non-white, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism."
* [Reclaiming Animism](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/36/61245/reclaiming-animism/) by Isabella Stengers (2012), "Reclaiming means recovering what we have been separated from, but not in the sense that we can just get it back. Recovering means recovering from the very separation itself, regenerating what this separation has poisoned." – *[Some of my own notes on this paper](https://osfairy.com/tag/isabelle-stengers/)*
