## Traditions
Sites that inspire me, shake the cobwebs from between my ears, etc. Interested in reconstruction in a polytheist context? Here's [this great post by Selgowiros from 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/heathenry/comments/dit35c/a_brief_primer_on_reconstruction_how_to_do_it_and/) I recommend reading.

### [The Longship](https://thelongship.net/)
> This website is just one of many possible beginner’s guides for a new Heathen, and is based on the style of Heathenry taught by established online communities and websites, in particular, Lārhūs Fyrnsida. (...) Heathenry is a revivalist religion seeking to bring the practice of the ancient Germanic peoples into the present day. In simplest terms, it uses information inferred or represented in scholarship to form the foundation of a modern, polytheistic religious tradition.

### [Toutâ Galation](https://toutagalation.org/basics-of-gaulish-polytheism/)
> Toutâ Galation is an organization dedicated to growth, promotion, and revival of Gaulish Polytheism as a living religious practice.

### [Sidjus Reidarje Sauilis](https://thesunriders.wordpress.com)
> This website is the online portal of Sidjus Reidarje Sauilis, a tradition of Gothic Heathenry focused on continuing the divine legacy of the Gods Gapt and Teiws. It is a reconstructed religion inspired by the beliefs and practices of the ancient Goths, who were in turn influenced by their neighbors across Europe and Eurasia.

### [Lārhūs Fyrnsida](https://larhusfyrnsida.com)
> The Lãrhus Fyrnsida site will serve as a tool for newcomers and other interested parties to learn more about the pre-Christian religion of the Germanic peoples who settled England in (approx.) the early 5th century (ie: The Anglo-Saxons).

### [Thia Frankisk Aldsido](https://frankisk-allodium.com/about/)
> Thia Frankisk Aldsido (TFA) can be translated into ModE as The Old Frankish Custom. It is a reconstructed and retro-engineered religious pursuit aimed at reviving the ontological condition of the ancient Frankish people(s). The time periods with which the religion is most concerned are the pre-Merovingian tribal age and that of the Merovingian age proper.
